- **Contact Information**
- **Career Summary**
- **Projects**
- **Skills Showcase**

## Tech Stack

- **TypeScript**
- **HTML & SCSS**
- **React.js**

## Plans

- **Multilingual Support:** While I'm starting with English, I'll be expanding to include Russian too. Toggle between languages seamlessly using Redux Toolkit. 
- **Advanced SCSS:** I'm diving deep into SCSS, exploring mixins, functions, placeholders, and more for a streamlined development process.
- **Accessibility & Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Ensuring everyone can access and enjoy the site, no matter their device or browser.
- **Adaptive design:** The website is built to ensure full adaptability across various screen sizes - on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
- **URL Language Parameters:** Language parameters will be added to the URL, along with anchors, to display the required section and language based on the URL. This functionality will be implemented using the useParams hook.

## Development Process

- **Branch Management:** Current changes are in "branch1", while only milestone-ready versions will make it to the "master" branch.
- **Documentation:** The project will be documented with JSDoc.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
